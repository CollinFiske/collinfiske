## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git
   cd portfolio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the site locally.

5. To deploy, build the project and upload the contents of the `build` directory to your web hosting service:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Customization

- Update the content in the React components to reflect your personal information.
- Modify styles in the CSS files to match your preferred design.
- Add your projects and update video demos in the `projects` section.
- Ensure video files are optimized for web viewing and consider hosting larger files externally.

## Adding Project Videos

To add video demos of your projects:

1. Place your video files in the `public/videos` directory.
2. In your project component, embed the video using the React Player component or HTML5 video tag.
3. Ensure videos are compressed and in a web-friendly format (e.g., MP4, WebM).

Example:
```jsx
<video width="100%" controls>
  <source src="/videos/project-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
